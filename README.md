# Hotel-Management-Database-System
The goal of the project is to design a relational database application for a hotel management system in MariaDB. 
Created an application to facilitate the day to day operations of Hotel Management System. The application retrieves data from the SQL database(MariaDB) based on the request of the user. Transactions were used to ensure data integrity and SQL authorization was used to ensure legal access. The application has four different views for employees in different positions based on their individual functionalities (Manager, Receptionist, Billing Staff, Maintenance Staff).

To run the program, download all the code files into a single folder and run the DBConnect.java file in the terminal. Make sure you have downloaded JAVA and MariaDB (MariaDB can be downloaded here https://mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb-tx).
